Quadcopter

Arduino Quadcopter, summer 2013

This is the Arduino software for the self-built quadcopter I helped work on.
An Adafruit LSM303 accel./compass and a Parallax L3G4200D gyroscope were used to build the IMU.

Issues
==========
1. PID loops need serious tuning
2. Remote control input needs work
